    <h3>Rescue Day</h3>
    <p>While I was out visiting a farm one day, I heard my friend call me over to a bucket on a bench. She had me look in the bucket, and lo and behold there was this tiny wrigling turtle inside! I absolutely love turtles, so I was so excited to see and hold what looked like a turtle hatchling!</p>

    <h3>New Home</h3>
    <p>I took Albertle home and learned how to make a nice and cozy aquarium for him to stay in. Here is a list of some of the things I used in his set-up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plenty of water for him to swim in</li>
        <li>A nice basking platform</li>
        <li>UVA and UVB light sources</li>
        <li>A good water filter</li>
        <li>A water heater</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There were some very helpful beginner guides to turtle care <a href="https://www.fishkeepingtoday.com/set-up-turtle-tank/#:~:text=How%20to%20Set%20Up%20Your%20Turtle%20Habitat%201,UVA%2C%20and%20UVB%20Light.%20...%20More%20items...%20" target="_blank">like this one</a> that helped me so much in creating the best habitat for Albertle.
    <h3>Swimmin' Sideways</h3>
    <p> After a few days, I noticed that he had been doing weird sneezes and coughs while he was on land, and swim sideways in the water. I started getting pretty concerned for the little guy, so I took him in to see a turtle specialist.</p>
    <p>The turtle specialist noticed that Albertle was very calm and didn't mind being examined, which was a big sign that something was wrong. Turtles are naturally very fiesty when being handled. Everything looked fine externally, so the vet took ablertle for some X-rays.</p>

    <p>We found out that Albertle had really bad pneumonia, and we had to give him shots for a few weeks until he got better.</p>
    <h3>Livin' the Dream</h3>
    <p>Now, Albertle is no longer fighting pneumonia. He has permanant lung scarring that has him swimming sideways for the rest of his life, but that's what makes him so unique and loveable. He now gets spoiled with food and treats and has grown so much compared to when I first found him, and his colors make him look like such a handsome boy!</p>
